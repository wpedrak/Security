**HTTP Public Key Pinning** (**HPKP**) is an Internet security mechanism delivered via an HTTP header which allows HTTPS websites to resist impersonation by attackers using mis-issued or otherwise fraudulent digital certificates. It does this by delivering a set of public keys to the client (e.g. web browser), which should be the only ones trusted for future connections to the same domain name.
